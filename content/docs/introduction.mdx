**Delta Components** is built (mainly) with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Motion (Framer Motion)
- zod (for input and form components)

## Why?

The web UI landscape has become increasingly standardized. While this standardization has brought many benefits—improved accessibility, better user experiences, and easier development—it has also led to a certain homogeneity. The web, in many ways, has become a bit... boring.

The aim of this project is to inject some playfulness into the web, by collecting the weird, fun, and sometimes useless UI magic you see in the wild.

Now you might ask, why create a copy-and-paste-able collection of components? The goal here is to re-create the most popular and delightful components from award-winning sites, so you can either use them in your project (adding your own spin), or simply use the code as inspiration for your own creations.

## Getting Started

To start using the components in your project, check out the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide.

## Open Source and Free

Delta Components is open source and free to use. You can use it for personal or commercial projects.

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. See the [contribution guide](https://github.com/pprunty/deltacomponents.dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
