## Why?

I’ve always wanted to put my name up against a beautifully designed, responsive and vibrant website and say “that there, I did that.”

Over the past 5 years I’ve been meddling with trying to do this. Procrastinating the actual realize of something official, I’d instead defer and create templates or “Lego blocks” I would promise to use in the real thing. These templates would ultimately go missing in the different codebases after I said like in Toy Story fashion “I don’t’ want to play with you anymore”. I realized I need help. I asked the internet and heard a distant echo. But when I started this vision, LLMs didn’t exist. I could never imagine creating a UI component library all by myself.

Thanks to LLMs and shadcn, I was able to do exactly that. Build a vibrant website with all the Lego blocks both you and I need to make the difference in your users’ experience that keeps them coming back.
