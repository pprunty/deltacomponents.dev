# Getting Started with Delta Components

Delta Components is a collection of high-quality React components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) with extended functionality, additional variants, and enhanced features.

## What is shadcn/ui?

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) is a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It's not a component library, but rather a collection of components that you can copy and paste into your projects.

Key features of shadcn/ui:

- **Not a dependency**: Components are copied directly into your project
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled using Tailwind CSS
- **Customizable**: Edit the components to match your needs
- **Accessible**: Built on top of Radix UI primitives
- **TypeScript**: Written in TypeScript for type safety

## What is v0?

v0 refers to shadcn's CLI tool that allows you to add components to your project. The "v0" prefix in commands indicates you're using this tool.

## Using Delta Components

Delta Components extends shadcn/ui with more complex, production-ready components built on the same principles. Here's how to use them:

### Installation

First, make sure you have shadcn/ui set up in your project. If not, follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).

Then, you can install any Delta component using the shadcn CLI with our registry URL:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://deltacomponents.dev/r/component-name.json"
```

For example, to add the TextInput component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://deltacomponents.dev/r/text-input.json"
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand format if you've configured the Delta registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "text-input"
```

### Using Components

After installation, you can import and use the components in your React components:

```tsx
import { TextInput } from "@/components/ui/text-input"

export default function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <TextInput
        label="Username"
        name="username"
        description="Enter your username"
        placeholder="johndoe"
        required
      />
      {/* Other form elements */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Component Features

Delta components extend shadcn with additional features:

- **Form validation**: Many components support Zod validation out of the box
- **Multiple variants**: Components often have additional style variants
- **Accessibility**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind
- **TypeScript**: Full type support for component props

## Example: Adding a Component

Here's a step-by-step example of adding and using the DateInput component:

1. Install the component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "date-input"
```

2. Use it in your application:

```tsx
import { DateInput } from "@/components/ui/date-input"

export default function MyForm() {
  return (
    <DateInput
      label="Start Date"
      name="start-date"
      description="Select when to start"
      minDate={new Date()}
    />
  )
}
```

## Customizing Components

Since Delta components follow the same philosophy as shadcn/ui, you can customize them by directly editing the files in your project. They're not a dependency, but rather code that lives in your project.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues installing components:

1. Make sure you have shadcn/ui properly configured
2. Check that you have all the required dependencies
3. Verify that your project structure matches the expected structure
