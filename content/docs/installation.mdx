You have two options to add a component to your project:

1. Using the CLI
2. Manually

## Using the CLI

<Steps>

<Step>Install the following dependencies:</Step>

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest motion
```

Or follow the Tailwind CSS installation guide to setup Tailwind CSS in your project.

<Step>Add a component to your project (choose one):</Step>

**Using the CLI:**

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://deltacomponents.dev/r/component-name.json"
```

<Admonition type="note" className="my-4">
  As of now, additional dependencies aren't installed automatically; they just
  get added to the package.json file. You need to run <code>npm install</code>{" "}
  or the equivalent command in your preferred package manager to install them.

The appropriate link is available in the "Installation" section of each component's documentation page.

</Steps>

## Manually

Go to any of the components you want to use and copy the source code(s) from the "Installation" section. Make sure to update your imports accordingly.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

<Admonition type="info" className="my-4">
  If you're using Tailwind CSS, make sure to add the delta directory to your `tailwind.config.ts` content paths so Tailwind can properly detect and compile the classes used in the components:

```typescript
export default {
  content: [
    // ... your existing paths
    "./delta/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  // ... rest of your config
}
```

</Admonition>

## Customization

All components in Delta Components are built to be customizable. You can modify the code to suit your needs, or extend the components with your own functionality. A useful way of modifying the component is by first opening it in [v0](https://v0.dev/chat) and prompt the AI for alterations.
