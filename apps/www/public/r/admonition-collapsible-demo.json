This usually occurs when there are mismatches between\n      server-rendered HTML and client-side React rendering. Check for\n      differences in component state, props, or conditional rendering logic.\n      Possible causes include asynchronous data fetching, usage of `useEffect`\n      for initial rendering, or differences in environment variables between\n      server and client. To resolve this issue, ensure that components render\n      identically on both server and client, and avoid side effects during\n      initial render. Consider adding proper loading states or fallbacks to\n      prevent UI mismatches.\n    </Admonition>\n  )\n}\n",
