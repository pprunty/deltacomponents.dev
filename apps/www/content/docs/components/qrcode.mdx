title: QR Code
description: A highly customizable QR code component with support for theme-aware coloring, custom dot styling, and logo embedding
---

<ComponentPreview name="qrcode-demo" dependencies={["qr-code-styling"]} />

## Installation

<Installation name="qrcode" dependencies={["qr-code-styling"]} />

## Usage

The QR code component uses `qr-code-styling` and automatically syncs with your shadcn/ui theme variables. It supports CSS variables for colors, making it theme-aware out of the box.

```tsx
import QRCode from "@/components/ui/qrcode"

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <QRCode
      value="https://deltacomponents.dev"
      size={200}
      dotStyle="rounded"
    />
  )
}
```

## Examples

### Styles Variations

Customize the dots, corner squares, and corner dots independently to match your brand identity.

<ComponentPreview
  name="qrcode-purple-dots-demo"
  dependencies={["qr-code-styling"]}
/>

### With Logo

Embed a logo in the center. The component automatically clears dots behind the logo to maintain scannability.

<ComponentPreview name="qrcode-logo-demo" dependencies={["qr-code-styling"]} />

### Clickable Navigation

Enable navigation to make the QR code clickable, opening the URL in a new tab. Includes keyboard accessibility support.

```tsx
<QRCode
  value="https://example.com"
  enableNavigation={true}
  size={200}
/>
```

## Notes

### Theme Awareness

This component uses a `resolveColor` helper that accepts CSS variables (e.g., `--color-background`) or direct color values (e.g., `#ffffff`). When CSS variables are provided, the component resolves them by reading computed styles from `document.documentElement`.

A `MutationObserver` watches for changes to the `class` and `data-theme` attributes on the document element, automatically updating the QR code when your theme switches. This ensures the QR code remains readable immediately after a theme toggle without requiring a page refresh.

### Error Correction Levels

The `level` prop controls how much data can be recovered if the QR code is damaged or obscured. Use higher levels when adding logos or when the code might be printed on textured surfaces:

- `"L"` (Low): ~7% recovery - Use for simple QR codes without logos
- `"M"` (Medium): ~15% recovery - Default for general use
- `"Q"` (Quartile): ~25% recovery - Recommended when adding small logos
- `"H"` (High): ~30% recovery - Use for large logos or when maximum durability is needed

When using `logoSize` above `0.2`, always use `level="Q"` or `level="H"` to maintain scannability.

### Logo Best Practices

When embedding logos:

- Keep `logoSize` between `0.15` and `0.25` for optimal balance between branding and scannability
- Use `logoMargin` to add padding around the logo (typically 4-8 pixels)
- Increase error correction level to `"Q"` or `"H"` when logo is present
- Test scannability with multiple QR code readers before deployment

### Empty State

When no `value` is provided, the component renders an animated placeholder with a dashed border. This is useful for loading states or form previews.

### Keyboard Accessibility

When `enableNavigation` is enabled, the QR code becomes a focusable button supporting both `Enter` and `Space` keys for activation. It also includes proper ARIA roles for screen reader support.
