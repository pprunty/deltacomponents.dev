## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) initialized (`npx shadcn@latest init`)

## CLI Installation

Run the add command with the specific component URL.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/<component>.json
```

This will automatically install necessary dependencies (e.g., `lucide-react`, `framer-motion`) and place the component code into your configured `components/ui` directory.

  title="Managing Component Weight"
>
  While most components use standard primitives, "Composite" components (like animated layouts) may require heavier libraries (e.g., `framer-motion`). If you have strict performance budgets, always review your `package.json` changes after installation.
