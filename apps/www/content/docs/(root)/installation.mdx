<Video comingSoon={true} title="Installation Tutorial" />

## Prerequisites

Before installing Delta Components UI, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project. If you don't have it setup, running any install command will set it up for you.

## Installation

Installing Delta Components UI components is straightforward using the standard shadcn CLI with our custom registry URL.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/<component>.json
```

For example, to install the admonition component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json
```

The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.

If you prefer, you can follow the [video tutorial](/docs/installation#video-tutorial) to get setup.
