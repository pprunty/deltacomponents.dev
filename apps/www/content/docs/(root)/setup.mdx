description: Getting started with Delta Components UI
---

Installing Delta Components UI components is straightforward using the standard shadcn CLI with our custom registry URL.
If you prefer, you can follow the [video tutorial](/docs/setup#video-tutorial)

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/<component>.json
```

For example, to install the orb component:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/orb.json
```

## Prerequisites

Before installing Delta Components UI, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project. If you don't have it setup, running any install command will set it up for you.

## Installing components

You can install Delta Components UI components using the `shadcn/ui` CLI with our registry URL. This will add the selected component's code and any needed dependencies to your project.

The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
