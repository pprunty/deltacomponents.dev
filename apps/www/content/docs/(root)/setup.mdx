description: Getting started with Delta Components UI

Installing Delta Components UI components is straightforward and can be done in a couple of ways. You can use the dedicated CLI command for the fastest setup, or integrate via the standard shadcn/ui CLI if you've already adopted shadcn's workflow.
If you prefer, you can follow the [video tutorial](/docs/setup#video-tutorial)

## Prerequisites

Before installing Delta Components UI, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project. If you don't have it setup, running any install command will set it up for you.

## Installing components

You can install Delta Components UI components using either the `@delta/agents-cli` CLI or the `shadcn/ui` CLI. Both achieve the same result: adding the selected component's code and any needed dependencies to your project.

The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder)..

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
