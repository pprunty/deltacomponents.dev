## Why are my components not styled?

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

---

## I ran the shadcn CLI but nothing was added to my project

Double-check that:

- Your current working directory is the root of your project (where package.json lives).
- Your components.json file (if using shadcn-style config) is set up correctly.
- You're using the correct CLI command with our registry URL:

```bash __pnpm__="pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json" __npm__="npm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json" __yarn__="yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json" __bun__="bun dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json"
npx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/admonition.json
```

## Theme switching doesn’t work — my app stays in light mode

Ensure your app is using the same data-theme system that shadcn/ui and AI Elements expect. The default implementation toggles a data-theme attribute on the `<html>` element. Make sure your tailwind.config.js is using class or data- selectors accordingly:

## The component imports fail with “module not found”

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your tsconfig.json has a proper paths alias for @/ i.e.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/_": ["./_"]
    }
  }
}
```
