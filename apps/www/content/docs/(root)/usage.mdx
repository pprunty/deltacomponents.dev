description: How to use Delta Components UI components in your application.
---

Once a Delta Components UI component is installed, you can import it and use it in your application like any other React component. The components are added as part of your codebase (not hidden in a library), so you can edit the components to suit your specific needs.

---

## Example

After installing Delta Components UI components, you can use them in your application like any other React component. For example:

```tsx
"use client"

import { Admonition } from "@/components/ui/admonition"


export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-8">
      <Admonition type="warning" title="Important Notice">
        This is a warning message that users should pay attention to.
      </Admonition>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Complex Example 

Some components are more complex and require a bit more setup. For example, the [chat](/docs/components/chat) component requires multiple imports compared to the [admonition](/docs/components/admonition) component.

To use the [chat](/docs/components/chat) component, should start by installing the component using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/chat.json
```

Then identify the code for the preview demo that you want to use from the [chat](/docs/components/chat) component page's documentation and copy and paste the code into your application. 

You can also use the "Copy Page" button and dropdown to interact with an LLM of your choice to help customize the code for your needs before pasting it into your application.
