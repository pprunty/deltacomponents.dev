Delta Components UI is a component library and custom registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build multimodal agentic experiences faster. It provides pre-built components for agents, transcription, audio & more.

Components are available via the `shadcn` CLI with our registry URL.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/<component>.json
```

For example, to install the [Orb](/docs/components/orb) component, you can run:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://deltacomponents.dev/r/orb.json
```

Here are some basic examples of what you can achieve using components from Delta Components UI.

You can explore more examples [here](/blocks) or view the [source code](https://github.com/pprunty/deltacomponents.dev) for all components on GitHub.
