Delta Components is a collection of high-performance, thoughtfully designed, and ready-to-use components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 


## Why?

Since the release of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), I've been blown away by the quality of the foundational components and what's possible to build with it. 

However, sometimes I've wanted *more* from my user interfaces and found myself returning to certain components I build in past projects that were not part of the foundational registry. 

That's where Delta Components comes in. Since shadcn/ui is not only a component library, it is [how you build your component library](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), it made sense for me to create a registry of components I've found useful over the years using the same copy/pate shadcn framework. 

Like shadcn/ui, Delta Components hands you the actual component code. Meaning, you have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:

- Full Transparency: You see exactly how each component is built.
- Easy Customization: Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.
- AI Integration: Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.

Whilst curating components in the registry, I'll endeavour to only include components that I believe are of high quality and capable of making a difference in your product. These can be big or small, ranging from a tidy 
[admonition](/docs/components/admonition) to a full-featured LLM
[chat](/docs/components/chat) interface. 

If you need a button, dialog, or dropdown, you can use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) registry. I will only include such components if they are a significant upgrade from the shadcn/ui version, or provide a UX that is not possible with the shadcn/ui version.

## How Should I Use Delta Components?

You should use shadcn/ui for foundational components, and Delta Components for when you need something extra. Both are built on top of the same framework, so you can use them together.

## Getting Started

To start using the components in your project, check out the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide.

## Open Source and Free

Delta Components is open source and free to use. You can use it for personal or commercial projects.
