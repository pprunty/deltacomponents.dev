Delta Components is a curated collection of specialized UI components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

While shadcn/ui provides the foundational building blocks, Delta Components focuses on molecular, production-ready components and interfaces from polished [admonitions](/docs/components/admonition) to full-featured [LLM chat interfaces](/docs/components/chat).

## Philosophy

Delta Components follows the same design principles as shadcn/ui:

* **Source Code ownership:** You don't install a library; you add the code to your project.
* **Zero Abstraction:** Full control to customize logic and styling.
* **AI Optimized:** Code structures designed to be easily parsed and iterated upon by LLMs.

## When to use Delta?

- Use **shadcn/ui** for foundational primitives (Buttons, Inputs, Dialogs).
- Use **Delta Components** when you need complex, interfaces or specialized UX patterns not found in the base registry.

## Open Source

Delta Components is free, open-source, and ready for personal or commercial projects.
[Contributions](https://github.com/pprunty/deltacomponents.dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.
