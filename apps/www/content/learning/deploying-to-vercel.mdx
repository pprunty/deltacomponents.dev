description: Learn how to deploy your Delta Components UI application to Vercel for production
---

Deploying your Delta Components UI application to Vercel is straightforward and provides excellent performance for React applications. This guide covers the complete deployment process from setup to production.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure you have:

- A Next.js project with Delta Components UI set up
- Your code in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com)

## Quick Deployment

The fastest way to deploy is using Vercel's Git integration:

### 1. Connect Your Repository

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### 2. Configure Build Settings

Vercel automatically configures most settings for Next.js projects, but you may need to adjust:

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` or `pnpm build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` or `pnpm install`

### 3. Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, add them in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add your variables for Production, Preview, and Development as needed

Common environment variables for Delta Components UI apps:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and Vercel will:

- Install dependencies
- Build your application
- Deploy to a production URL
- Provide a live URL for your application

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain:

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS settings as instructed

### Build Optimization

For better performance with Delta Components UI:

```javascript
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ["lucide-react"],
  },
  // Enable if using audio components
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.(mp3|wav|ogg)$/,
      type: "asset/resource",
    })
    return config
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Preview Deployments

Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for:

- Pull requests
- Pushes to non-production branches

This is perfect for testing Delta Components UI changes before going live.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If your build fails:

1. **Check the build logs** in the Vercel dashboard
2. **Verify all dependencies** are in package.json
3. **Test locally** with `npm run build`
4. **Check for TypeScript errors** if using TypeScript

### Audio Component Issues

If using Delta Components UI audio components:

1. Ensure audio files are in the `public` directory
2. Add proper MIME types in `next.config.js`
3. Consider using a CDN for large audio files

### Performance Issues

For optimal performance:

1. **Enable Next.js Image Optimization**
2. **Use dynamic imports** for heavy components
3. **Implement proper caching** strategies
4. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** in Vercel Analytics

## Continuous Deployment

Once connected, Vercel provides automatic deployments:

- **Production**: Deploys from your main branch
- **Preview**: Deploys from feature branches and PRs
- **Rollback**: Easy rollback to previous deployments

## Monitoring

Vercel provides built-in monitoring:

- **Analytics**: Page views and performance metrics
- **Functions**: Serverless function monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Test locally** before pushing to production
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Enable preview deployments** for team collaboration
4. **Monitor performance** regularly
5. **Set up proper error boundaries** for Delta Components UI components

## Next Steps

After deploying successfully:

- Set up [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) for performance insights
- Configure [speed insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights)
- Consider [edge functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) for global performance
- Explore [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) for data storage needs

Your Delta Components UI application is now live and ready for users to experience your multimodal agentic interfaces!
