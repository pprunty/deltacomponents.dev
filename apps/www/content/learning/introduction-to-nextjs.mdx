# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides the foundation for building modern, full-stack web applications. It offers many features out of the box that make development faster and more efficient.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables you to create server-side rendering and static web applications using React. It provides a zero-configuration build setup, automatic code splitting, and many other features that enhance the development experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js automatically renders pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
Generate static pages at build time for maximum performance.

### 3. File-based Routing
Create routes by simply adding files to the `pages` or `app` directory.

### 4. API Routes
Build API endpoints directly within your Next.js application.

### 5. Automatic Code Splitting
Next.js automatically splits your code to only load what's necessary for each page.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of Next.js, you can learn about integrating it with component libraries like shadcn/ui to build powerful user interfaces.
